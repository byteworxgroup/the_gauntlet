# Challenge 4!

**Johnny likes a night out on the town as much as the next guy, but he does not want to get buzzed every time he goes out, so he comes up with some rules**

- He will go out and drink alcohol when the day of the year is divisible by 3 (BUZZED)
- He will go out and drink fizzy drink when the day of the year is divisible by 5 (FIZZY)
- Some days he can't make up his mind and will drink both alcohol and soda but only when the day of the year is divisible by both 3 and 5 (FIZZY BUZZED)
- If none of the rules above apply he will stay at home. (STAYING IN)
