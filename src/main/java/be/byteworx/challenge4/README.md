# Challenge 4!

The IT department had a really nice idea we should start scoring features by complexity.  
Unfortunately the devs keep forgetting the fibonacci sequence. Can you help them out?  
Example: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
Write a method that prints out all the numbers of the fibonacci sequence until the number exceeds a max range:
fibList(n) where max fib number in list is smaller than n
