Looks like Johnny's braindamage is getting worse, now he can't even remember his grandma's phone number anymore.  
Luckily he knows some smart devs that can write him a program that can tell him if the number will be problematic or not.

Example: 383383383 is not problematic because it is a palindrome, 383383384 is problematic because it is not a palindrome.
